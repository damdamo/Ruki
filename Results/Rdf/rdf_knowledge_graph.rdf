    dc:description "The paper presents empirical research on the quality of the toponyms that can be retrieved from OpenStreetMap (OSM) under the purpose of enriching authoritative toponymic databases and gazetteers. An analysis on the volatility of places and points-of-interest (POIs) is presented. We examine how named features behave and change in terms of type, name and location. The challenge is to understand the behavior and consequently the fitness-for-purpose of OSM data when it comes to a possible use and integration with authoritative datasets. We show that, depending on the OSM feature type, the volatility can vary considerably and we elucidate which feature types are consistent, and thus could be used in authoritative gazetteers despite their grassroots nature and if there are spatial patterns behind the location changes of features during their lifespan." ;

    dc:description "The evaluation of VGI quality has been a very interesting and popular issue amongst academics and researchers. Various metrics and indicators have been proposed for evaluating VGI quality elements. Various efforts have focused on the use of well-established methodologies for the evaluation of VGI quality elements against authoritative data. In this paper, a number of research papers have been reviewed and summarized in a detailed report on measures for each spatial data quality element. Emphasis is given on the methodology followed and the data used in order to assess and evaluate the quality of the VGI datasets. However, as the use of authoritative data is not always possible many researchers have turned their focus on the analysis of new quality indicators that can function as proxies for the understanding of VGI quality. In this paper, the difficulties in using authoritative datasets are briefly presented and new proposed quality indicators are discussed, as recorded through the literature review. We classify theses new indicators in four main categories that relate with: i) data, ii) demographics, iii) socio-economic situation and iv) contributors. This paper presents a dense, yet comprehensive overview of the research on this field and provides the basis for the ongoing academic effort to create a practical quality evaluation method through the use of appropriate quality indicators." ;

    dc:description "The appearance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) in 2004 sparked a phenomenon known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Today, VGI comes in many flavours (e.g. toponyms, GPS tracks, geo-tagged photos, micro-blogging or complete topographic maps) and from various sources. One subject that has attracted research interest from the early days of VGI is how good such datasets are and how to combine them with authoritative datasets. To this end, the paper explores three intertwined subjects from a quality point of view First, we examine the topo-semantic consistency of OSM data by evaluating a number of rules between polygonal and linear features and then paying special attention to quality of Points of Interest (POIs). A number of topo-semantic rules will be used to evaluate the valididy of features’ location. The focus then turns to the use of geo-tagged photos to evaluate the location and type of OSM data and to disambiguate topological issues that arise when different OSM layers overlap." ;

    dc:description "The last few years have seen the emergence of a large number of worldwide web portals where volunteers report and collect observations of plants and animals, share these reports with other users, and provide data for scientific research purposes along the way. Activities engaging citizens in the collection of scientific data or in solving scientific problems are collectively called citizen science. Data quality is a vital issue in this field. Currently, reports of species observations from citizen scientists are often validated manually by experts as a means of quality control. Experts evaluate the plausibility of a report based on their own expertise and experience. However, a rapid growth in the quantity of reports to be processed makes this approach increasingly less feasible, creating a need for methods supporting (semi)automatic validation of observation data. This aim is achieved primarily by analysing the spatial and temporal context of the data. Relevant context information can be provided by existing observation data, as well as by spatial data of environmental factors, or other spatio-temporal factors impacting the distribution of species, or the process of observation and contribution itself. It is very important that the specific properties of data emerging from citizen science origins are taken into account. These data are often not produced in a systematic way, resulting in (for instance) spatial and temporal incompleteness. Also, the data structure is not only determined by the natural spatio-temporal patterns of species distribution, but by other factors such as the behaviour of contributors or the design of the citizen science project that produced the data as well." ;

The public transportation system is one of the most effected parts and as the situation is degrading, more and more people become reluctant to take public transport. The fine tuning of the system, or even its restructuring, requires an immense amount of data, which traditionally can only be collected via costly and time consuming ways, like deploying sensors, conveying surveys, just to name a few. Not to mention that during this process, the citizens do not experience too much improvement, and become easily skeptical concerning the outcomes. Is there really no other way? In this demo, we present and demonstrate our approach to solve this problem in the form of a smart phone application providing real-time feedback on public transport, transits, and user-reviews based on crowdsensing." ;

However, the traditional approach to deploy a sensing and monitoring infrastructure is usually expensive and not always practical. Mobile crowd-sourcing can open new ways for data collection and smart city services. In this case, mobile devices with their built-in sensors and their owners are used to monitor the environment. For instance, the timetable of a smart travel planner service can be updated in real-time based on the continuously monitored time gap by passengers between consecutive buses on a public transportation route. This requires a common communication model facilitating crowd-sourced data collection. In this paper, we overview the design considerations of crowd-sourcing based smart city applications, propose data collection via using the publish/subscribe communication model and investigate the possible use of the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for such applications." ;

For instance, a live timetable service for public transportation or real-time traffic jam notification can increase the efficiency of travel planning substantially. Traditionally, the implementation of these smart city services require the deployment of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure. As an alternative, the crowd of inhabitants can be involved in data collection via their mobile devices. This emerging paradigm is called mobile crowd-sensing or participatory sensing. In this paper, we present our generic framework built upon XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) for mobile participatory sensing based smart city applications. After giving a short description of this framework we show three use-case smart city application scenarios, namely a live transit feed service, a soccer intelligence agency service and a smart campus application, which are currently under development on top of our framework." ;

    dc:description "We spend a substantial part of our time with traveling, in crowded cities usually taking public transportation. It is important, making travel planning easier, to have accurate information about vehicle arrival times at the stops. Most of the public transport operators make their timetables freely available either on the web or in some special format, like GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification). However, they contain static information only, not reflecting the actual traffic conditions. Mobile participatory sensing can help extend the basic service with real-time updates letting the crowd collect the required data. With this respect we believe that such participatory sensing based application must offer a day zero service following incremental service extension. In this paper, we discuss how to realize real-time refinements to static GTFS data based on mobile participatory sensing. We show how this service can be implemented by an XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) based mobile participatory sensing architecture and we evaluate its performance." ;

In default of offering convenient and reliable service the passengers tend to consider other transport alternatives. However, even a relatively simple functional enhancement, such as providing real-time timetable information, requires considerable investment and effort following traditional means, e.g. deploying sensors and building a background communication and processing infrastructure. Using the power of crowd to gather the required data, share information and send feedback is a viable and cost effective alternative. In this demonstration, we present TrafficInfo, our prototype smart phone application to implement a participatory sensing based live public transport information service. TrafficInfo visualizes the actual position of public transport vehicles with live updates on a map, and gives support to crowd sourced data collection and passenger feedback." ;

Unfortunately, the static schedule information of the public transport vehicles, available at the stops, on the web or in some special format like GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification), usually does not reflect the actual traffic situation. However, realtime traffic updates require the gathering of an immense amount of tracking data. Mobile crowdsensing, via the mobile devices of the crowd, can offer a cheap and efficient way for collecting such data. Nonetheless, for motivating active participation some day zero service must be provided to the users. In this paper, we discuss how to realize a live public transport information service extending a static timetable based on GTFS data, as the day zero service, using the power of the crowd for data collection. We detail the design of such a service implemented by an XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) based mobile crowdsensing architecture and evaluate its performance. We show how we can build a scalable service architecture even with commodity hardware to handle thousands of users." ;

Thanks to the integrated sensors they can report about visited places, movement types and speed of the users. However, efficient stopping event detection on public transport vehicles is still a challenge. These events, associated with the coordinates of real stations, can be useful to update public transit timetables according to real-time traffic. In field tests we evaluated the most commonly available suitable sensors' precision and efficiency and developed our Stopping Event Detection Algorithm (SEDA), which utilizes only the accelerometer to find potential stopping times and the Wi-Fi sensor to validate or discard them by a novel localization method. Wi-Fi is used only 6.66% of the time of actual traveling on public vehicles. Our algorithm is shown to recognize properly 82.9-89.47% of public traffic stations while consuming daily only 13% the capacity of an average smartphone's battery." ;

Therefore, flood management is a crucial task for municipalities - a task that requires dependable information to evaluate risks and to react accordingly in a disaster scenario. Acquiring and maintaining this information using official data however is not always feasible, especially for smaller municipalities. This issue could be approached by integrating the collaborative maps of OpenStreetMap (OSM). The OSM data is openly accessible, adaptable and continuously updated. Nonetheless, to mak euse of this data for effective decision support, the OSM data must be first adapted  to the needs of decision makers. In the pursuit of this goal, this paper presents the OpenFloodRiskMap (OFRM) -a prototype for a OSM based spatial decision-support system.

    dc:description "Georeferenced user-generated datasets like those extracted from Twitter are increasingly gaining the interest of spatial analysts. Such datasets oftentimes reflect a wide array of real-world phenomena. However, each of these phenomena takes place at a certain spatial scale. Therefore, user-generated datasets are of multiscale nature. Such datasets cannot be properly dealt with using the most common analysis methods, because these are typically designed for single-scale datasets where all observations are expected to reflect one single phenomenon (e.g., crime incidents). In this paper, we focus on the popular local G statistics. We propose a modified scale-sensitive version of a local G statistic. Furthermore, our approach comprises an alternative neighbourhood definition that enables to extract certain scales of interest. We compared our method with the original one on a real-world Twitter dataset. Our experiments show that our approach is able to better detect spatial autocorrelation at specific scales, as opposed to the original method. Based on the findings of our research, we identified a number of scale-related issues that our approach is able to overcome. Thus, we demonstrate the multiscale suitability of the proposed solution." ;

    dc:description "Twitter and related social media feeds have become valuable data sources to many fields of research. Numerous researchers have thereby used social media posts for spatial analysis, since many of them contain explicit geographic locations. However, despite its widespread use within applied research, a thorough understanding of the underlying spatial characteristics of these data is still lacking. In this paper, we investigate how topological outliers influence the outcomes of spatial analyses of social media data. These outliers appear when different users contribute heterogeneous information about different phenomena simultaneously from similar locations. As a consequence, various messages representing different spatial phenomena are captured closely to each other, and are at risk to be falsely related in a spatial analysis. Our results reveal indications for corresponding spurious effects when analyzing Twitter data. Further, we show how the outliers distort the range of outcomes of spatial analysis methods. This has significant influence on the power of spatial inferential techniques, and, more generally, on the validity and interpretability of spatial analysis results. We further investigate how the issues caused by topological outliers are composed in detail. We unveil that multiple disturbing effects are acting simultaneously and that these are related to the geographic scales of the involved overlapping patterns. Our results show that at some scale configurations, the disturbances added through overlap are more severe than at others. Further, their behavior turns into a volatile and almost chaotic fluctuation when the scales of the involved patterns become too different. Overall, our results highlight the critical importance of thoroughly considering the specific characteristics of social media data when analyzing them spatially." ;

Thus, the spatiotemporal analysis of Location Based Social Networks (LBSN) has great potential regarding the ability to sense spatial processes and to gain knowledge about urban dynamics, especially with respect to collective human mobility behavior. The objective of this paper is to explore the semantic association between georeferenced tweets and their respective spatiotemporal whereabouts. We apply a semantic topic model classification and spatial autocorrelation analysis to detect tweets indicating specific human social activities. We correlated observed tweet patterns with official census data for the case study of London in order to underline the significance and reliability of Twitter data. Our empirical results of semantic and spatiotemporal clustered tweets show an overall strong positive correlation in comparison with workplace population census data, being a good indicator and representative proxy for analyzing workplace-based activities." ;

In order to understand urban processes and to gain deeper knowledge about cities, the potential of location-based social networks like Twitter could be used a promising example to explore latent relationships of underlying mobility patterns. In this paper, we therefore present an approach using a geographic self-organizing map (Geo-SOM) to uncover and compare previously unseen patterns from social media and authoritative data. The results, which we validated with Live Traffic Disruption (TIMS) feeds from Transport for London, show that the observed geospatial and temporal patterns between special events (r = 0.73), traffic incidents (r = 0.59) and hazard disruptions (r = 0.41) from TIMS, are strongly correlated with traffic-related, georeferenced tweets. Hence, we conclude that tweets can be used as a proxy indicator to detect collective mobility events and may help to provide stakeholders and decision makers with complementary information on complex mobility processes." ;

    dc:description "In the past few years, volunteers have produced geographic information of different kinds, using a variety of different crowdsourcing platforms, within a broad range of contexts. However, there is still a lack of clarity about the specific types of tasks that volunteers can perform for deriving geographic information from remotely sensed imagery, and how the quality of the produced information can be assessed for particular task types. To fill this gap, we analyse the existing literature and propose a typology of tasks in geographic information crowdsourcing, which distinguishes between classification, digitisation and conflation tasks. We then present a case study related to the “Missing Maps” project aimed at crowdsourced classification to support humanitarian aid. We use our typology to distinguish between the different types of crowdsourced tasks in the project and choose classification tasks related to identifying roads and settlements for an evaluation of the crowdsourced classification. This evaluation shows that the volunteers achieved a satisfactory overall performance (accuracy: 89%; sensitivity: 73%; and precision: 89%). We also analyse different factors that could influence the performance, concluding that volunteers were more likely to incorrectly classify tasks with small objects. Furthermore, agreement among volunteers was shown to be a very good predictor of the reliability of crowdsourced classification: tasks with the highest agreement level were 41 times more probable to be correctly classified by volunteers. The results thus show that the crowdsourced classification of remotely sensed imagery is able to generate geographic information about human settlements with a high level of quality. This study also makes clear the different sophistication levels of tasks that can be performed by volunteers and reveals some factors that may have an impact on their performance." ;

    dc:description "An increasing number of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and social media platforms have been continuously growing in size, which have provided massive georeferenced data in many forms including textual information, photographs, and geoinformation. These georeferenced data have either been actively contributed (e.g., adding data to OpenStreetMap (OSM) or Mapillary) or collected in a more passive fashion by enabling geolocation whilst using an online platform (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, or Flickr). The benefit of scraping and streaming these data in stand-alone applications is evident, however, it is difficult for many users to script and scrape the diverse types of these data. On 14 June 2016, a pre-conference workshop at the AGILE 2016 conference in Helsinki, Finland was held. The workshop was called “LINK-VGI: LINKing and analyzing VGI across different platforms”. The workshop provided an opportunity for interested researchers to share ideas and findings on cross-platform data contributions. One portion of the workshop was dedicated to a hands-on session. In this session, the basics of spatial data access through selected Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and the extraction of summary statistics of the results were illustrated. This paper presents the content of the hands-on session including the scripts and guidelines for extracting VGI data.

    dc:description "(1) Background: Due to the advent of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), large datasets of user-generated Points of Interest (POI) are now available. As with all VGI, however, there is uncertainty concerning data quality and fitness-for-use. Currently, the task of evaluating fitness-for-use of POI is left to the data user, with no guidance framework being available which is why this research proposes a generic approach to choose appropriate measures for assessing fitness-for-use of crowdsourced POI for different tasks. (2) Methods: POI are related to the higher-level concept of geo-atoms in order to identify and distinguish their two basic functions, geo-referencing and object-referencing. Then, for each of these functions, suitable measures of positional and thematic quality are developed based on existing quality indicators. (3) Results: Typical use cases of POI are evaluated with regards to their use of the two basic functions of POI, and allocated appropriate measures for fitness-for-use. The general procedure is illustrated on a brief practical example. (4) Conclusion: This research addresses the issue of fitness-for-use of POI on a higher conceptual level by relating it to more fundamental notions of geographical information representation. The results are expected to assist users of crowdsourced POI datasets in determining an appropriate method to evaluate fitness-for-use." ;

Integrating local knowledge, personal experience and up-to-date geoinformation indicates a promising approach for the theoretical framework and the methods of natural hazard analysis. Our systematic literature review aims at identifying current research and directions for future research in terms of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) within natural hazard analysis. Focusing on both the preparedness and mitigation phase results in eleven articles from two literature databases. A qualitative analysis for in-depth information extraction reveals auspicious approaches regarding community engagement and data fusion, but also important research gaps. Mainly based in Europe and North America, the analysed studies deal primarily with floods and forest fires, applying geodata collected by trained citizens who are improving their knowledge and making their own interpretations. Yet, there is still a lack of common scientific terms and concepts. Future research can use these findings for the adaptation of scientific models of natural hazard analysis in order to enable the fusion of data from technical sensors and VGI. The development of such general methods shall contribute to establishing the user integration into various contexts, such as natural hazard analysis." ;

    dc:description "The increased development of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and its potential role in GIScience studies raises questions about the resulting data quality. Several studies address VGI quality from various perspectives like completeness, positional accuracy, consistency, etc. They mostly have consensus on the heterogeneity of data quality. The problem may be due to the lack of standard procedures for data collection and absence of quality control feedback for voluntary participants. In our research, we are concerned with data quality from the classification perspective. Particularly in VGI-mapping projects, the limited expertise of participants and the non-strict definition of geographic features lead to conceptual overlapping classes, where an entity could plausibly belong to multiple classes, e.g., lake or pond, park or garden, marsh or swamp, etc. Usually, quantitative and/or qualitative characteristics exist that distinguish between classes. Nevertheless, these characteristics might not be recognizable for non-expert participants. In previous work, we developed the rule-guided classification approach that guides participants to the most appropriate classes. As exemplification, we tackle the conceptual overlapping of some grass-related classes. For a given data set, our approach presents the most highly recommended classes for each entity. In this paper, we present the validation of our approach. We implement a web-based application called Grass Green that presents recommendations for crowdsourcing validation. The findings show the applicability of the proposed approach. In four months, the application attracted 212 participants from more than 35 countries who checked 2,865 entities. The results indicate that 89% of the contributions fully/partially agree with our recommendations. We then carried out a detailed analysis that demonstrates the potential of this enhanced data classification. This research encourages the development of customized applications that target a particular geographic feature." ;

    dc:description "Contribution inequality widely exists in OpenStreetMap (OSM), which means that most data come from a minority of the contributors, while the majority only accounts for a small percentage of data. This phenomenon is of great importance to understanding from where the data come and how the project evolves. The investigation in this paper is dedicated to answering the following questions: How does contribution inequality change over time in OSM? Which group of contributors plays a more important role in influencing trends in contribution inequality: the “vocal minority” or the “silent majority”? To answer the first question, we provide overall measurements for contribution inequality using the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient. To answer the second question, we use quantile-based classifying strategy to analyze structural changes in the community, and use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test to analyze productivity changes. Our case study shows that in countries without significant imports, contributions become more unequal over time. This trend is consistent with the rapid expansion of the silent majority, even though other classes of contributors also grow at a slower pace. On the other hand, contribution inequality fluctuates a lot in countries with huge imports, and agrees well with the productivity changes in the vocal minority." ;

Research has proven that the resulting data in some areas are of decent quality, which guarantees their usability in various applications. Though these achievements are normally attributed to the huge heterogeneous community mainly consisting of amateurs, it is in fact a small percentage of major contributors who make nearly all contributions. In this paper, we investigate the contributing behaviors of these contributors to deduce whether they are actually professionals. Various indicators are used to depict the behaviors on three themes: practice, skill and motivation, aiming to identify solid evidence for expertise. Our case studies show that most major contributors in Germany, France and the United Kingdom are hardly amateurs, but are professionals instead. These contributors have rich experiences on geographical data editing, have a decent grasp of professional software and work on the project with enthusiasm and concentration. It is less unexpected that they can create geographic data of high quality." ;

    dc:description "Matching road networks is an essential step for data enrichment and data quality assessment, among other processes. Conventionally, road networks from two datasets are matched using a line-based approach that checks for the similarity of properties of line segments. In this article, a polygon-based approach is proposed to match the OpenStreetMap road network with authority data. The algorithm first extracts urban blocks that are central elements of urban planning and are represented by polygons surrounded by their surrounding streets, and it then assigns road lines to edges of urban blocks by checking their topologies. In the matching process, polygons of urban blocks are matched in the first step by checking for overlapping areas. In the second step, edges of a matched urban block pair are further matched with each other. Road lines that are assigned to the same matched pair of urban block edges are then matched with each other. The computational cost is substantially reduced because the proposed approach matches polygons instead of road lines, and thus, the process of matching is accelerated. Experiments on Heidelberg and Shanghai datasets show that the proposed approach achieves good and robust matching results, with a precision higher than 96% and a F1-score better than 90%." ;

Researchers from various disciplines have performed geospatial analysis on social media data despite the data’s high dimensionality, complexity and heterogeneity. However, user-generated datasets are of multi-scale nature, which results in limited applicability of commonly known geospatial analysis methods. Therefore in this paper, we propose a geographic, hierarchical self-organizing map (Geo-H-SOM) to analyze geospatial, temporal and semantic characteristics of georeferenced tweets. The results of our method, which we validate in a case study, demonstrate the ability to explore, abstract and cluster high-dimensional geospatial and semantic information from crowdsourced data." ;

    dc:description "Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) such as data derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project is a popular data source for freely available geographic data. Normally, untrained contributors gather these data. This fact is frequently a cause of concern regarding the quality and usability of such data. In this study, the quality of OSM land use and land cover (LULC) data is investigated for an area in southern Germany. Two spatial data quality elements, thematic accuracy and completeness are addressed by comparing the OSM data with an authoritative German reference dataset. The results show that the kappa value indicates a substantial agreement between the OSM and the authoritative dataset. Nonetheless, for our study region, there are clear variations between the LULC classes. Forest covers a large area and shows both a high OSM completeness (97.6%) and correctness (95.1%). In contrast, farmland also covers a large area, but for this class OSM shows a low completeness value (45.9%) due to unmapped areas. Additionally, the results indicate that a high population density, as present in urbanized areas, seems to denote a higher strength of agreement between OSM and the DLM (Digital Landscape Model). However, a low population density does not necessarily imply a low strength of agreement." ;

    dc:description "Due to its relatively high availability and low cost, location-based social network (LBSN) (e.g., Foursquare) data (a popular type of volunteered geographic information) seem to be an alternative or complement to survey data in the study of travel behavior and activity analysis. Illustrating this situation, recently, a number of studies attempted to use LBSN data (e.g., Foursquare check-ins) to investigate patterns of human travel and activity. Of particular note is that compared to other individual-level characteristics of users, such as age, profession, education, income and so forth, gender is relatively highly available in the profiles of Foursquare users. Moreover, considering gender differences in travel and activity analysis is a popular research topic and is helpful in better understanding the changes in women’s roles in family, labor force participation, society and so forth. Therefore, this paper empirically investigates how gender influences the travel and activity patterns of active local Foursquare users in New York City. Empirical investigations of gender differences in travel and activity patterns are conducted at both the individual and aggregate level. The empirical results reveal that there are gender differences in the travel and activity patterns of active local users in New York City at both the individual and aggregate level. Finally, the results of the empirical study and the extent to which LBSN data can be exploited to produce travel diary data are discussed." ;

This paper assumes that emerging Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) contain contextual information rich enough to be used in order to contextualize such an evaluation process. This assumption is demonstrated through an exploratory analysis of a Foursquare check-in dataset, which reveals the impacts of two contextual factors—temporal and spatial—on mobility patterns. This paper then proposes an approach that may be used to contextualize the evaluation of geographic information’s relevance. The proposed algorithm links a priori relevance to the contextualized relevance using the hidden impacts of contextual factors. Improved performance from the experiments carried out confirms the validity of the proposed approach, as well as the benefits of utilizing contextual information within the relevance evaluation process." ;

First, it provides security, e.g., for a form on a website, by means of a test that only a human could solve. Second, the effort of the user for this test is used to generate additional information, e.g., digitization of books or identification of house numbers. In this work, we present a concept for adapting the reCAPTCHA idea to create user-generated geographic information from earth observation data, and the requirements during the conception and implementation are depicted in detail. Furthermore, the essential parts of a Geo-reCAPTCHA system are described, and afterwards transferred, to a prototype implementation. An empirical user study is conducted to investigate the Geo-reCAPTCHA approach, assessing time and quality of the resulting geographic information. Our results show that a Geo-reCAPTCHA can be solved by the users of our study on building digitization in a short amount of time (19.2 s on average) with an overall average accuracy of the digitizations of 82.2%. In conclusion, Geo-reCAPTCHA has the potential to be a reasonable alternative to the typical reCAPTCHA, and to become a new data-rich channel of crowdsourced geographic information." ;

    dc:description "The type of data an individual contributor adds to OpenStreetMap (OSM) varies by region. The local knowledge of a data contributor allows for the collection and editing of detailed features such as small trails, park benches or fire hydrants, as well as adding attribute information that can only be accessed locally. As opposed to this, satellite imagery that is provided as background images in OSM data editors, such as ID, Potlatch or JOSM, facilitates the contribution of less detailed data through on-screen digitizing, oftentimes for areas the contributor is less familiar with. Knowing whether an area is part of a contributor’s home region or not can therefore be a useful predictor of OSM data quality for a geographic region. This research explores the editing history of nodes and ways for 13 highly active OSM members within a two-tiered clustering process to delineate an individual mapper’s home region from remotely mapped areas. The findings are evaluated against those found with a previously introduced method which determines a contributor’s home region solely based on spatial clustering of created nodes. The comparison shows that both methods are able to delineate similar home regions for the 13 contributors with some differences." ;

    dc:description "Until recently, land surveys and digital interpretation of remotely sensed imagery have been used to generate land use inventories. These techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements, stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects. Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and classification of land use as well as geographical features. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques, contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning decisions for stakeholders and policymakers." ;

The collected geodata are heterogeneous in terms of different dimensions such as spatial patterns of contributions, quality, patterns of contributing individuals, and type of contributions. Because contributors’ personal information is anonymously stored by the OSM administrators, alternative methods are needed to investigate the role of contributors’ characteristics on their mapping behavior. This study is intended to explore the potential socio-economic characteristics of contributors in highly contributed areas to have better insights about the latent patterns of involved individuals in a highly dynamic state of the most active country in OSM, Germany. A logistic regression model (LRM) is applied to discover the potential correlations between dependent and independent variables. The findings explain that the areas with high population density, middle level of education, high income, high rate of overnight stays, high number of foreigners, and residents aged from 18 to 69 are more likely to be involved in OSM. Furthermore, the degree of dynamism in OSM is a function of proximity to built-up areas. Finally, concluding remarks concerning the independent variables and model sensitivity are presented." ;

    dc:description "This study proposes a novel approach for extracting multilane roads from urban road networks in OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets as functional high-level roads, thereby allowing comparative analyses to determine the differences between this functional hierarchy and other hierarchies. OSM road networks have high levels of detail and complex structures, but they also have large numbers of duplicated lines for the same road features, which leads to difficulties and low efficiency when extracting multilane roads using conventional methods based on the analysis and operations of line segments. To overcome these deficiencies, a polygon-based method is proposed that is based on shape analysis and Gestalt theory, which treats polygons surrounded by roads as operating elements. First, shape descriptors are calculated for each polygon in networks and are used for classification. Second, candidate multilane polygons are classified as seeds based on all the polygons used as shape descriptors by a support vector machine. Finally, based on the seed polygons, a region-growing method is proposed that connects and fills the multilane features according to Gestalt theory. An experiment using OSM data from different urban networks verified the validity of the proposed method. The method achieved good and effective extraction performance, regardless of the complexity and duplication of data sets. Thus, a comparative analysis with high-level roads extracted based on road type attributes and structural analysis was performed to demonstrate the differences between the constructed road levels and other hierarchies." ;

    dc:description "Data on population at building level is required for various purposes. However, to protect privacy, government population data is aggregated. Population estimates at finer scales can be obtained through areal interpolation, a process where data from a first spatial unit system is transferred to another system. Areal interpolation can be conducted with ancillary data that guide the redistribution of population. For population estimation at the building level, common ancillary data include three-dimensional data on buildings, obtained through costly processes such as LiDAR. Meanwhile, volunteered geographic information (VGI) is emerging as a new category of data and is already used for purposes related to urban management. The objective of this paper is to present an alternative approach for building level areal interpolation that uses VGI as ancillary data. The proposed method integrates existing interpolation techniques, i.e., multi-class dasymetric mapping and interpolation by surface volume integration; data on building footprints and points-of-interest (POIs) extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) are used to refine population estimates at building level. A case study was conducted for the city of Hamburg and the results were compared using different types of POIs. The results suggest that VGI can be used to accurately estimate population distribution, but that further research is needed to understand how POIs can reveal population distribution patterns." ;

Using large volumes of user-generated mobile phone data, we derive mobile communication profiles that we use as a proxy for the collective human activity. In this article, geocomputational methods and geovisual analytics such as self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to explore the variations of these profiles, and its implications for collective human activity. We evaluate the merits of SOM as a cross-dimensional clustering technique and derived temporal trajectories of variations within the mobile communication profiles. The trajectories’ characteristics such as length are discussed, suggesting spatial variations in intensity and similarity in collective human activity. Trajectories are linked back to the geographic space to map the spatial and temporal variation of trajectory characteristics. Different trajectory lengths suggest that mobile phone activity is correlated with the spatial configuration of the city, and so at different times of the day. Our approach contributes to the understanding of the space-time social dynamics within urban environments." ;

Each wheelchair type and, more importantly, each individual user might have different needs with regards to the way condition or other criteria. This study proposes a new approach to route planning for wheelchair users tailored for individual and personal requirements provided by the user and the calculation of a reliability factor of the computed wheelchair path. The routing graph is based on the freely available Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) retrieved from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. The newly created algorithm is evaluated and tested for a selected area in Bonn, Germany. A new reliability factor is introduced that gives direct feedback about the quality of the generated path. Similar factor estimations can also be utilized for multiple route planning applications where VGI or other commercial or administrative data is implemented and more detailed factors than a simple geometric representation of a street network are of importance." ;

    dc:description "Natural disasters like floods are a worldwide phenomenon and a serious threat to mankind. Flood simulations are applications of disaster control, which are used for the development of appropriate flood protection. Adequate simulations require not only the geometry but also the roughness of the Earth’s surface, as well as the roughness of the objects hereon. Usually, the floodplain roughness is based on land use/land cover maps derived from orthophotos. This study analyses the applicability of roughness map derivation approaches for flood simulations based on different datasets: orthophotos, LiDAR data, official land use data, OpenStreetMap data and CORINE Land Cover data. Object-based image analysis is applied to orthophotos and LiDAR raster data in order to generate land cover maps, which enable a roughness parameterization. The vertical vegetation structure within the LiDAR point cloud is used to derive an additional floodplain roughness map. Further roughness maps are derived from official land use data, OpenStreetMap and CORINE Land Cover datasets. Six different flood simulations are applied based on one elevation data but with the different roughness maps. The results of the hydrodynamic–numerical models include information on flow velocity and water depth from which the additional attribute flood intensity is calculated of. The results based on roughness maps derived from LiDAR data and OpenStreetMap data are comparable, whereas the results of the other datasets differ significantly." ;

    dc:description "In the past two years, several applications of generating three-dimensional (3D) buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) have been made available, for instance, OSM-3D, OSM2World, OSM Building, etc. In these projects, 3D buildings are reconstructed using the buildings’ footprints and information about their attributes, which are documented as tags in OSM. Therefore, the quality of 3D buildings relies strongly on the quality of the building footprints data in OSM. This article is dedicated to a quality assessment of building footprints data in OSM for the German city of Munich, which is one of the most developed cities in OSM. The data are evaluated in terms of completeness, semantic accuracy, position accuracy, and shape accuracy by using building footprints in ATKIS (German Authority Topographic–Cartographic Information System) as reference data. The process contains three steps: finding correspondence between OSM and ATKIS data, calculating parameters of the four quality criteria, and statistical analysis. The results show that OSM footprint data in Munich have a high completeness and semantic accuracy. There is an offset of about four meters on average in terms of position accuracy. With respect to shape, OSM building footprints have a high similarity to those in ATKIS data. However, some architectural details are missing; hence, the OSM footprints can be regarded as a simplified version of those in ATKIS data." ;

The ubiquitous usage of location-enabled devices, such as smartphones, allows contributors to share their geographic information on a number of selected online portals. The collected information is oftentimes referred to as volunteered geographic information (VGI). One of the most utilized, analyzed and cited VGI-platforms, with an increasing popularity over the past few years, is OpenStreetMap (OSM), whose main goal it is to create a freely available geographic database of the world. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in VGI research, focusing on its collaboratively collected geodata and corresponding contributor patterns. Additionally, trends in the realm of OSM research are discussed, highlighting which aspects need to be investigated more closely in the near future." ;

    dc:description "The generation of a routing network for disabled people inherits a number of prerequisites that need special consideration. Widespread routing applications that rely on commercial or governmental geodata sources are not feasible for this specific task, due to the lack of detailed information about features such as sidewalks, surface conditions or road incline. In recent years the research community has experienced a strong increase in studies related to routing applications tailored to disabled people in which the lack of a sophisticated dataset played a major role. This study proposes an algorithm for the generation of a disabled people friendly routing network, based on collaboratively collected geodata provided by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project. This new representation of a routing graph can be used in numerous applications and maps dedicated to people with disabilities. The algorithm is tested and evaluated for selected areas in Europe, resulting in newly generated extended networks that include sidewalk information. The results have shown that the success of the final implementation of the introduced algorithm depends highly on the attribute quality of the OSM dataset." ;

    dc:description "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is one of the most popular examples of a Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) project. In the past years it has become a serious alternative source for geodata. Since the quality of OSM data can vary strongly, different aspects have been investigated in several scientific studies. In most cases the data is compared with commercial or administrative datasets which, however, are not always accessible due to the lack of availability, contradictory licensing restrictions or high procurement costs. In this investigation a framework containing more than 25 methods and indicators is presented, allowing OSM quality assessments based solely on the data's history. Without the usage of a reference data set, approximate statements on OSM data quality are possible. For this purpose existing methods are taken up, developed further, and integrated into an extensible open source framework. This enables arbitrarily repeatable intrinsic OSM quality analyses for any part of the world." ;

    dc:description "Geotagged photos on social media like Flickr explicitly indicate the trajectories of tourists. They can be employed to reveal the tourists’ preference on landmarks and routings of tourism. Most of existing works on routing searches are based on the trajectories of GPS-enabled devices’ users. From a distinct point of view, we attempt to propose a novel approach in which the basic unit of routing is separate road segment instead of GPS trajectory segment. In this paper, we build a recommendation system that provides users with the most popular landmarks as well as the best travel routings between the landmarks. By using Flickr geotaggged photos, the top ranking travel destinations in a city can be identified and then the best travel routes between the popular travel destinations are recommended. We apply a spatial clustering method to identify the main travel landmarks and subsequently rank these landmarks. Using machine learning method, we calculate the tourism popularity of the road in terms of relevant parameters, e.g., the number of users and the number of Point-of-Interests. These popularity assessments are integrated into the routing recommendation system. The routing recommendation system takes into consideration both the popularity assessment and the length of the road. The best route recommended to the user minimizes the distance while including maximal tourism popularity. Experiments were conducted in two different scenarios. The empirical results show that the recommendation system is able to provide the user good travel planning including both top ranking landmarks and suitable routings in a city. Besides, the system offers user-generated semantic information for the recommended routes." ;

    dc:description "The increasing availability of sensor devices has resulted in important volumes of sensor data, which has raised the issue of making these data fully discoverable and interpretable by applications and end-users. The idea of OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) has addressed this issue by proposing a set of standards to enable accessibility of sensor data over the Web. Similarly, there is a growing interest in volunteered geographic information (VGI). Considering that several researchers have highlighted the potential of this new type of information as a complement to existing, “traditional” data, it becomes important to develop frameworks to support the integration of VGI from several sources and with other types of data. In this paper, we make a first step in this direction by proposing a framework for the semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI. After having performed an investigation of the types of VGI applications, we have developed a conceptual model of VGI aligned with relevant ISO standards for describing geospatial features. The purpose of this model is to support the generation of common descriptions for VGI applications, which will act as interfaces to higher-level services, such as discovery and reasoning services, in order to be exploited in conjunction with sensor data by client applications. This process is described through architecture for semantic interoperability of sensor data and VGI that we have developed and that we intend to use to set guidelines for future research on integration of VGI in sensor data cyberinfrastructures. We illustrate the possibilities created by the proposed framework with a description of the various services and interfaces required to implement the framework." ;

    dc:description "The assessment of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data quality has become an interdisciplinary research area over the recent years. The question of whether the OSM road network should be updated through periodic data imports from public domain data, or whether the currency of OSM data should rather rely on more traditional data collection efforts by active contributors, has led to perpetual debates within the OSM community. A US Census TIGER/Line 2005 import into OSM was accomplished in early 2008, which generated a road network foundation for the active community members in the US. In this study we perform a longitudinal analysis of road data for the US by comparing the development of OSM and TIGER/Line data since the initial TIGER/Line import. The analysis is performed for the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, and 70 Urbanized Areas. In almost all tested states and Urbanized Areas, OSM misses roads for motorized traffic when compared with TIGER/Line street data, while significant contributions could be observed in pedestrian related network data in OSM compared with corresponding TIGER/Line data. We conclude that the quality of OSM road data could be improved through new OSM editor tools allowing contributors to trace current TIGER/Line data." ;

    dc:description "Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) projects and their crowdsourced data have been the focus of a number of scientific analyses and investigations in recent years. Oftentimes the results show that the collaboratively collected geodata of one of the most popular VGI projects, OpenStreetMap (OSM), provides good coverage in urban areas when considering particular completeness factors. However, results can potentially vary significantly for different world regions. In this article, we conduct an analysis to determine similarities and differences in data contributions and community development in OSM between 12 selected urban areas of the world. Our findings showed significantly different results in data collection efforts and local OSM community sizes. European cities provide quantitatively larger amounts of geodata and number of contributors in OSM, resulting in a better representation of the real world in the dataset. Although the number of volunteers does not necessarily correlate with the general population density of the urban areas, similarities could be detected while comparing the percentage of different contributor groups and the number of changes they made to the OSM project. Further analyses show that socio-economic factors, such as income, can have an impact on the number of active contributors and the data provided in the analyzed areas. Furthermore, the results showed significant data contributions by members whose main territory of interest lies more than one thousand kilometers from the tested areas." ;

    dc:description "A large number of applications have been launched to gather geo-located information from the public. This article introduces an approach toward generating land-use patterns from volunteered geographic information (VGI) without applying remote-sensing techniques and/or engaging official data. Hence, collaboratively collected OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets are employed to map land-use patterns in Vienna, Austria. Initially the spatial pattern of the landscape was delineated and thereafter the most relevant land type was assigned to each land parcel through a hierarchical GIS-based decision tree approach. To evaluate the proposed approach, the results are compared with the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) data. The results are compared in two ways: first, the texture of the resulting land-use patterns is analyzed using texture-variability analysis. Second, the attributes assigned to each land segment are evaluated. The achieved land-use map shows kappa indices of 91, 79, and 76% agreement for location in comparison with the GMESUA data set at three levels of classification. Furthermore, the attributes of the two data sets match at 81, 67, and 65%. The results demonstrate that this approach opens a promising avenue to integrate freely available VGI to map land-use patterns for environmental planning purposes." ;

    dc:description "The OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, a well-known source of freely available worldwide geodata collected by volunteers, has experienced a consistent increase in popularity in recent years. One of the main caveats that is closely related to this popularity increase is different types of vandalism that occur in the projects database. Since the applicability and reliability of crowd-sourced geodata, as well as the success of the whole community, are heavily affected by such cases of vandalism, it is essential to counteract those occurrences. The question, however, is: How can the OSM project protect itself against data vandalism? To be able to give a sophisticated answer to this question, different cases of vandalism in the OSM project have been analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the current OSM database and its contributions have been investigated by applying a variety of tests based on other Web 2.0 vandalism detection tools. The results gathered from these prior steps were used to develop a rule-based system for the automated detection of vandalism in OSM. The developed prototype provides useful information about the vandalism types and their impact on the OSM project data." ;

    dc:description "Crowdsourced geodata has been proven to be a rich and major data source for environmental simulations and analysis, as well as the visualization of spatial phenomena. With the increasing size and complexity of public buildings, such as universities or hotels, there is also an increasing demand for information about indoor spaces. Trying to stimulate this growing demand, both researchers and Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) communities envision to extend established communities towards indoors. It has already been showcased that VGI from OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be utilized for different applications in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) as well as for simple shortest path computations inside buildings. The here presented research now tries to utilize crowdsourced indoor geodata for more complex indoor routing scenarios of multiple users. Essentially, it will be investigated if, and to what extent, the available data can be utilized for performing indoor evacuation simulations with the simulation framework MATSim. That is, this paper investigates the suitability of crowdsourced indoor information from OSM (IndoorOSM) for evacuation simulations. Additionally, the applicability of MATSim for agent-based indoor evacuation simulations is conducted. The paper discusses the automatic generation simulation-related data, and provides experimental results for two different evacuation scenarios. Furthermore, limitations of the IndoorOSM data and the MATSim framework for indoor evacuation simulations are elaborated and discussed." ;

    dc:description "About one decade has passed since US vice president Al Gore articulated his vision of Digital Earth (DE). Within this decade, a global multi-resolution and three-dimensional (3D) representation of the Earth, which sums up the DE vision, increasingly gained interest in both public and science. Due to the desired high resolution of the available data, highly detailed 3D city models comprise a huge part of DE and they are becoming an essential and useful tool for a range of different applications. In the past as well as at present, 3D models normally come from a range of different sources generated by professionals, such as laser scans or photogrammetry combined with 2D cadaster data. Some models are generated with semi-automated or fully automated approaches, but in most cases manual fine tuning or even manual construction from architectural plans is required. Further beyond outdoor city models, DE additionally envisages the provision of indoor information. That is, the interior structure of public or publically accessible buildings, such as airports or shopping malls, is represented and made available in 3D; however, at the moment, such models are mostly created by hand and essentially based on professional data sources. In contrast to such professional data, which is mainly captured by surveyors or companies, the last few years revealed the phenomenon of crowdsourced geodata, which receives an increasing attractiveness as an alternative data source for many Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Former research already demonstrated the power and richness of such geodata – especially OpenStreetMap (OSM) – and it has also been proved that this non-standardized, crowdsourced geodata can be combined with international standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). For example, CityGML Level-of-Detail 1 (LoD1) and LoD2 models have already been created automatically from OSM. The research presented in this article will further continue on the automated generation of CityGML models from OpenStreetMap. Essentially, a method for the creation of highly detailed CityGML LoD4 models with interior structures will be explained. By applying the invented approach on existing OSM data, limitations and restrictions of the IndoorOSM mapping proposal, the available data and the developed approach are revealed and discussed." ;

In total, more than half a million members had registered for the project by the end of 2011. However, while this number of contributors seems impressive, questions remain about the individual contributions that have been made by the project members. This research article contains several studies regarding the contributions by the community of the project. The results show that only 38% (192,000) of the registered members carried out at least one edit in the OSM database and that only 5% (24,000) of all members actively contributed to the project in a more productive way. The majority of the members are located in Europe (72%) and each member has an activity area whose size may range from one soccer field up to more than 50 km2.

    dc:description "Routing services for outdoor areas are omnipresent and also three-dimensional (3D) visualization is quite common within this area. Recent research efforts are now trying to adapt well known outdoor routing services to complex indoor environments. However, most of the current indoor routing systems only focus on two-dimensional visualization, thus only one level can be depicted. Especially multi-level routes therefore lack visualization. Also, most of the (few) existing 3D indoor routing services utilize proprietary software or plugins, thus a widespread accessibility for those services by using common computers or mobile devices is not feasible. Therefore this paper describes the development of a web-based 3D routing system based on a new HTML extension. The visualization of rooms as well as the computed routes is realized with XML3D. Since this emerging technology is based on WebGL and will likely be integrated into the HTML5 standard, the developed system is already compatible with most common browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox. Another key difference of the approach presented in this paper is that all utilized data is actually crowdsourced geodata from OpenStreetMap (OSM). Such data is collaboratively collected by both amateurs and professionals and can be used at no charge under the Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL). Our research combines user-generated geo content of the Web 2.0 with future Internet technology for the provision of a ubiquitously accessible 3D indoor routing application." ;

Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the “free” geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered “complete” in relative comparison to a commercial dataset." ;

To mitigate the effect of completeness errors in OSM, this study proposes a methodological framework for predicting by means of OSM urban areas in Europe that are currently not mapped or only partially mapped. For this purpose, a machine learning approach consisting of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms is applied. Under the premise of existing OSM data, the model estimates missing urban areas with an overall squared correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.589. Interregional comparisons of European regions confirm spatial heterogeneity in the model performance, whereas the R 2 ranges from 0.129 up to 0.789. These results show that the delineation of urban areas by means of the presented methodology depends strongly on location." ;

The support of the publication of VGI-system descriptions on the Web eases the reuse of VGI, which in its turn supports the demand for a better spatial coverage of volunteered geo-information. This paper describes an approach for the collaborative development of an ontology of VGI concepts and the creation of Linked Data for real-life VGI resources.

    dc:description "Abstract: This contribution introduces the concept of Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) as a specific type of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). Unlike other kind of VGI, which may originate from geographic measurements crowdsourcing, SMGI brings in addition a special potential for it may express community perceptions, interests, needs, and behaviors. Hence, SMGI may represent an unprecedented resource for expressing pluralism in such domains as spatial planning, where it may convey the community collective preferences contributing to enrich knowledge able to inform design and decision making. In the light of these assumptions, the main issues relevant for SMGI collection and analytics are presented from the perspective of the spatial planning and governance domain, and a framework for the SMGI analytics in planning, design, and decision making is proposed." ;

    dc:description "Abstract This paper introduces the concept of Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) as an emergent pluralist source of information which – it is argued- may find valuable application in spatial planning and Geodesign. On the base of empirical research, the author proposes a tentative framework for SMGI Analytics in spatial planning. Among other methods, Spatial-Temporal Textual Analysis (STTx) is proposed as a tool to investigate people perceptions and interest in space and time. Possible implications and benefits of SMGI analytics for the planning practice emerge from the overall discussion." ;

Explicit and Implicit Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) from social media platforms, namely Social Media Geographic Information (SMGI) resources, were used to explore novel methods and tools for analysis and knowledge construction. The results concern three main research streams carried on with the common feature of integrating social media and other volunteered and authoritative sources of information from Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). These findings demonstrated that the integration of SMGI with more traditional Authoritative Geographic Information (A-GI) may offer a high potential for eliciting pluralist knowledge for spatial planning." ;

    dc:description "This article sets forth the early phases of a methodological proposal for designing and developing Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) initiatives based on a system perspective analysis in which the components depend and interact dynamically among each other. First, it focuses on those characteristics of VGI projects that present different goals and modes of organization, while using a crowdsourcing strategy to manage participants and contributions. Next, a tool is developed in order to design the central crowdsourced processing unit that is best suited for a specific project definition, associating it with a trend towards crowd-based or community-driven approaches. The design is structured around the characterization of different ways of participating, and the task cognitive demand of working on geo-information management, spatial problem solving and ideation, or knowledge acquisition. Then, the crowdsourcing process design helps to identify what kind of participants are needed and outline subsequent engagement strategies. This is based on an analysis of differences among volunteers’ participatory behaviors and the associated set of factors motivating them to contribute, whether on a crowd or community-sourced basis. From a VGI system perspective, this paper presents a set of guidelines and methodological steps in order to align project goals, processes and volunteers and thus successfully attract participation. This methodology helps establish the initial requirements for a VGI system, and, in its current state, it mainly focuses on two components of the system: project and participants." ;

By describing real examples of Volunteer Geographic  Information (VGI), the contribution establishes a categorization based on the characteristics of the information, tasks, and scopes of the projects. After a discussion on the relationships of categories and VGI quality, the paper analyses techniques to improve the quality of volunteered information according to the moment of its assessment (i.e., ex ante, ex post, or both with respect to information creation).

    dc:description "The paper analyses the challenges and problems posed by the use of Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) in citizen science and a proposal is formulated for assessing VGI quality based on a linguistic decision making approach so as to allow its feasible use for scientific purposes. VGI quality is represented by indicators at distinct levels of granularity which take into account the distinct components of the VGI items. The quality indicators represent both the extrinsic quality, depending on the characteristics and reputation of the sources of information; the intrinsic quality, depending on the distinct accuracy and precision of information; and, last but not least, the pragmatic quality, depending on the user needs and intended purposes. In order to assess the pragmatic quality of VGI items, a linguistic decision making approach is defined that allows users to rank and finally filter the VGI items based on the satisfaction of distinct criteria expressed by means of both linguistic terms, defining soft constraints on the distinct quality indicators, and linguistic aggregators, defining fuzzy operators which combine the satisfaction degrees of the soft constraints at distinct hierarchical levels to yield the final satisfaction of the VGI items. Finally, an example of quality assessment in a glaciological citizen science project is discussed." ;

    dc:description "European Alpine glaciology has a long tradition of studies and activities, in which researchers have often relied on the field work of some specialized volunteer operators. Despite the remarkable results of this cooperation, some problems in field data harmonization and in covering the whole range of monitored glaciers are still present. Moreover, dynamics of reduction, fragmentation and decline, which in recent decades characterize Alpine glaciers, make more urgent the need to improve spatial and temporal monitoring, still maintaining adequate quality standards. Scientific field monitoring activities on Alpine glaciers run parallel to a number of initiatives by individuals and amateur associations, keepers of alternative, experiential and para-scientific knowledge of the glacial environment. Problems of harmonization, coordination, recruitment and updating can be addressed with the help of a collaborative approach—citizen science-like—in which the scientific coordination guarantees information quality and web 2.0 tools operate as mediators between expert glaciologists and non-expert contributors. This paper gives an overview of glaciological information currently produced in the European Alpine region, representing it in an organized structure, functional to the discussion. An empowering solution is then proposed, both methodological and technological, for the integration of multisource data. Its characteristics, potentials and problems are discussed." ;

The first part focuses on the main features of volunteered geographic information (VGI) and open source mapping tools. The second part of the paper develops a case study. It will be shown how user-generated information might be used for investigating a social and political topic and how thematic maps representing the analysis may be obtained with different mapping tools. That analysis has been developed using geocoded tweets from Twitter, concerning some of the most important Italian politicians. The paper closes with some remarks on the potentialities and the limits, the opportunities and the difficulties of the emerging Web 2.0 applications and it aims at showing that user-generated data and information can play an important role in geographical research and in mapping activities, to help to better understand political as well as social and economical phenomenon." ;

In particular public administrations are called upon to reinvent the governance of public affairs and to update the means for interacting with their communities. The paper develops an analysis of the distribution, diffusion and performance of the official profiles on Twitter adopted by the Italian municipalities (comuni) up to November 2013. It aims to identify the patterns of spatial distribution and the drivers of the diffusion of Twitter profiles; the performance of the profiles through an aggregated index, called the Twitter performance index (Twiperindex), which evaluates the profiles’ activity with reference to the gravitational areas of the municipalities in order to enable comparisons of the activity of municipalities with different demographic sizes and functional roles. The results show that only a small portion of innovative municipalities have adopted Twitter to enhance e-participation and e-governance and that the drivers of the diffusion seem to be related either to past experiences and existing conditions (i.e. civic networks, digital infrastructures) developed over time or to strong local community awareness. The better performances are achieved mainly by small and medium-sized municipalities. Of course, the phenomenon is very new and fluid, therefore this analysis should be considered as a first step in ongoing research which aims to grasp the dynamics of these new means of public communication." ;

However, these new phenomena continue to be tied to reality and its places. In this context, the contribution aims to understand the role of Twitter as a lens through which to analyze the trends in political weight, to understand the importance of urban areas into dynamics that affect the use of tools associated with Web 2.0, and finally to understand the role of proximity in the construction of political opinion." ;

    dc:description "Stalking Pincopallino: surveillance, privacy and proximity in the age of Twitter. – Our online behaviour and actions leave digital traces that recent technological developments make easy to collect and analyze. These ‘digital footprints’ often come equipped with geographic coordinates, therefore making them directly georeferenced and placeable in space. The ability to infer individual and societal behaviour from this information, their large amount, and the possibility of observing behavioural phenomena in real time, introduce new issues related to the invasion of privacy. This materializes the risk of negative ‘lateral surveillance’ as a consequence of increasing availability of this information to ordinary Internet users. Through the analysis of the activity of an (unaware) Twitter user, Pincopallino, this article highlights the inferential potential of this new geographic information, and the privacy risks inherent in the spread of georeferenced content." ;

    dc:description "Humans perceive and evaluate environments affectively. Some places are experienced as unsafe, while some others as attractive and interesting. These affective responses to environments influence people’s daily behavior and decision-making in space, e.g., choosing which route to take, or which place to visit. In this article, we report on a methodology of using people’s affective responses to environments for enhancing computer-based route planning. More specifically, we explore a crowdsourcing approach to model and collect people’s affective responses to environments; an Affect-Space-Model and a mobile application are developed to facilitate this crowdsourcing approach; a routing algorithm (named AffectRoute) is then proposed to aggregate and integrate the collected data for automatic route planning. Evaluation with human participants shows that the routes generated by considering people’s affective responses to environments are significantly preferred over the conventional shortest ones, which are employed in car navigation systems and many online route planners. In conclusion, considering people’s affective responses to environments contributes to the improvement of automatic route planning. The proposed method can be integrated into existing route-planning services (e.g., location-based services) to provide users with more satisfying routing results." ;

These data, especially geotagged ones, contain lots of information about people’s perception of and experiences in various environments. This article presents three case studies to illustrate the potential of these data for understanding people’s perception and knowledge of environments, especially urban environments. Results of the case studies show that social media data are a useful source for studying how people perceive, conceptualise, and feel about environments. Finally, this article discusses some socio-technical challenges that need further investigations when analysing social media data, such as the “digital divide”, data quality, and privacy." ;

    dc:description "Rapid technological development and the introduction of smart services make it possible for modern cities to o er an enhanced perception of city life for their inhabitants. For instance, a smart timetable service of the city’s public trans- portation lines updated in real-time can decrease unnecessary waiting times at stops and increase the e ciency of travel planning. However, the implementa- tion of such a service in a traditional way requires the deployment and mainte- nance of some costly sensing and tracking infrastructure. Fortunately, for this purpose mobile crowdsensing can be a viable and almost free of charge alterna- tive. In this case, the crowd of passengers and their mobile devices are used to gather data.  In this chapter, we place emphasis on the introduction of a crowdsensing based smart timetable service, which has been developed as a prototype smart city application.  e front-end interface of this service is called Tra cInfo. It is a simple and easy-to-use Android application which visualizes public transport information of the given city on Google Maps in real-time.  e live updates of transport schedule information rely on the automatic stop event detection of public transport vehicles. Tra cInfo is built upon an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based communication framework which was designed to facilitate the development of crowd assisted smart city applications. The chapter introduces this generic framework shortly, then describes the pro- totype smart timetable service." ;

By doing so, subjective spatial relations towards space are developed, which in turn, affect decision-making and behavior in space (e.g. fearful places are avoided, attractive places are explored). In other words, humans perceive and respond to their environment. Most geospatial applications however, rely on objective geospatial data to provide services and decision support to its users. This paper reports on results of a research project, which aims at acquiring people´s subjective relations to space, as well as at attaining usercentered services by incorporating subjective data into geospatial applications.

    dc:description "This paper introduces a simulation environment developed for analyzing crowd-sensing based applications in the Smart City application domain. As a case study, an urban parking application scenario is investigated and presented. In this scenario, smart citizens collect and share parking related events, such as leaving or occupying a free parking spot. These events can be presented on a real-time city map and used in navigation software, thereby helping others alleviate parking related issues, such as the time spent while cruising for parking. The simulation environment, implemented in Java, allows to investigate and assess the critical user base of crowd-sensing based smart city applications, and the requisites (benefits, challenges) of introducing such applications. Our simulation results show that considerable gain (approx. 15%) can be achieved in the cruising time even with relatively low (30%) user base in a medium size city (Novi Sad, Serbia). Moreover, the proposed simulation environment can be used also in real field measurements by replacing/extending input data from real users." ;

    dc:description "The goal of this paper is to analyze existing simulation engines and assess how well-suited they are for simulating the formation, existence and dissolution of dynamic social networks, with a special emphasis on networks formed around crowdsensing efforts. The crowd in this context is a loosely-coupled social network of people, who use their mobile devices to collect and share data and receive some sort of service or satisfaction in return. Often it is hard to predict whether users would like a certain future crowdsensing application, therefore it is necessary to simulate the expected behavior of the crowd in a pre-specified simulation environment. This paper proposes an urban parking scenario, in which the drivers collect and share parking related events. The main part of this research is the analysis of three simulation engines, which will show which is the best suited for simulating dynamic social networks formed around crowdsensing efforts. The results will show that there are generic simulation environments capable of simulating large crowds, which also possess suitable visualization tools and integration with geospatial data." ;

The integration of rich sensing capabilities (e.g. camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometer, barometer) in today’s mobile devices allows their users to sense their urban environment in often unforeseen ways. In mobile crowd-sensing the citizens of the Smart City collect, share and jointly use services based on the sensed data, e.g. the Waze application for optimized car-based navigation, the Smart Citizen project for collecting meteorological measurements. This paper presents the current state-of-the-art and future challenges in mobile crowd-sensing in urban environments, by focusing on sensing in the following focus areas: environment, citizen collaboration, urban traffic systems, health/fitness and social networking. From each of these areas a set of representative applications (e.g. Waze, Foursquare, Ushahidi) were selected, analyzed and compared based on the following criteria: expected social and economic impact, novelty and sophistication of system architecture, sensing methods applied, motivation techniques and user privacy." ;

    dc:description "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is the largest spatial database of the world. One of the most frequently occurring geospatial elements within this database is the road network, whose quality is crucial for applications such as routing and navigation. Several methods have been proposed for the assessment of OSM road network quality, however they are often tightly coupled to the characteristics of the authoritative dataset involved in the comparison. This makes it hard to replicate and extend these methods. This study relies on an automated procedure which was recently developed for comparing OSM with any road network dataset. It is based on three Python modules for the open source GRASS GIS software and provides measures of OSM road network spatial accuracy and completeness. Provided that the user is familiar with the authoritative dataset used, he can adjust the values of the parameters involved thanks to the flexibility of the procedure. The method is applied to assess the quality of the Paris OSM road network dataset through a comparison against the French official dataset provided by the French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN). The results show that the Paris OSM road network has both a high completeness and spatial accuracy. It has a greater length than the IGN road network, and is found to be suitable for applications requiring spatial accuracies up to 5-6 m. Also, the results confirm the flexibility of the procedure for supporting users in carrying out their own comparisons between OSM and reference road datasets." ;

    dc:description "OpenStreetMap (OSM) is currently the largest openly licensed collection of geospatial data. Being OSM increasingly exploited in a variety of applications, research has placed great attention on the assessment of its quality. This work focuses on assessing the quality of OSM buildings. While most of the studies available in literature are limited to the evaluation of OSM building completeness, this work proposes an original approach to assess the positional accuracy of OSM buildings based on comparison with a reference dataset. The comparison relies on a quasi-automated detection of homologous pairs on the two datasets. Based on the homologous pairs found, warping algorithms like e.g. affine transformations and multi-resolution splines can be applied to the OSM buildings to generate a new version having an optimal local match to the reference layer. A quality assessment of the OSM buildings of Milan Municipality (Northern Italy), having an area of about 180 km2, is then presented. After computing some measures of completeness, the algorithm based on homologous points is run using the building layer of the official vector cartography of Milan Municipality as the reference dataset. Approximately 100000 homologous points are found, which show a systematic translation of about 0.4 m on both the X and Y directions and a mean distance of about 0.8 m between the datasets. Besides its efficiency and high degree of automation, the algorithm generates a warped version of OSM buildings which, having by definition a closest match to the reference buildings, can be eventually integrated in the OSM database." ;

However, their creation is time consuming and therefore updated LULCM are seldom available. The  OpenStreetMap (OSM) collaborative project collects a rich set of vector data provided  by volunteers at a global scale. It has already been shown that OSM data may be converted into LULCM, but data quality issues in OSM raise some challenges for this conversion, such as overlapping features that  should be assigned to different classes. Thus, the creation of LULCM using OSM requires a solution for handling these inconsistencies. In this article an automated methodology is proposed using rules of decision and spatial analysis in a GIS environment to convert OSM features into LULCM, which automatically solves the inconsistencies mentioned above. The methodology is applied to two areas in Europe and the results are compared to available LULCM." ;

A number of different remotely-sensed global land cover products are available but studies have shown that there are large spatial discrepancies between these different products when compared. To address this issue of land cover uncertainty, a tool called Geo-Wiki was developed, which integrates online and mobile applications, high resolution satellite imagery available from Google Earth, and data collection through crowdsourcing as a mechanism for validating and improving globally relevant spatial information on land cover and land use. Through its growing network of volunteers and a number of successful data collection campaigns, almost 5 million samples of land cover and land use have been collected at many locations around the globe. This paper provides an overview of the main features of Geo-Wiki, and then using a series of examples, illustrates how the crowdsourced data collected through Geo-Wiki have been used to improve information on land cover and land use." ;

    dc:description "Citizens are increasingly becoming an important source of geographic information, sometimes entering domains that had until recently been the exclusive realm of authoritative agencies. This activity has a very diverse character as it can, amongst other things, be active or passive, involve spatial or aspatial data and the data provided can be variable in terms of key attributes such as format, description and quality. Unsurprisingly, therefore, there are a variety of terms used to describe data arising from citizens. In this article, the expressions used to describe citizen sensing of geographic information are reviewed and their use over time explored, prior to categorizing them and highlighting key issues in the current state of the subject. The latter involved a review of ~100 Internet sites with particular focus on their thematic topic, the nature of the data and issues such as incentives for contributors. This review suggests that most sites involve active rather than passive contribution, with citizens typically motivated by the desire to aid a worthy cause, often receiving little training. As such, this article provides a snapshot of the role of citizens in crowdsourcing geographic information and a guide to the current status of this rapidly emerging and evolving subject." ;

It is still an emerging field and many different approaches can be used to take value from VGI, but also many pros and cons are related to its use. Therefore, since it is timely to get an overview of the subject, the aim of this article is to review the use of VGI as reference data for land cover map validation. The main platforms and types of VGI that are used and that are potentially useful are analysed. Since quality is a fundamental issue in map validation, the quality procedures used by the platforms that collect VGI to increase and control data quality are reviewed and a framework for addressing VGI quality assessment is proposed. A review of cases where VGI was used as an additional data source to assist in map validation is made, as well as cases where only VGI was used, indicating the procedures used to assess VGI quality and fitness for use. A discussion and some conclusions are drawn on best practices, future potential and the challenges of the use of VGI for land cover map validation." ;

    dc:description "The proliferation of inexpensive and highly mobile and location aware devices together with Web 2.0 technology have fostered the emergence of the citizen as a source of data. Mapping presently benefits from vast amounts of spatial data as well as people able to provide observations of geographic phenomena, which can inform map production, revision and evaluation. The great potential of these developments is, however, often limited by concerns. The latter span issues from the nature of the citizens through the way data are collected and shared to the quality and trustworthiness of the data. This book reports on some of the key issues connected with the use of citizen sensors in mapping. It arises from a European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action, which explored issues linked to topics ranging from citizen motivation, data acquisition, data quality and the use of citizen derived data in the production of maps that rival, and sometimes surpass, maps arising from authoritative agencies." ;

Despite the growing body of research dedicated to the use of VGI in crisis management, studies are still needed that systematically investigate the incorporation of VGI into practical emergency management. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a research design for investigating and planning the incorporation of VGI into work practices and decision-making of emergency agencies by means of simulation exercises. Furthermore, first lessons are drawn from a field study performed within a simulation exercise of an urban fire in Coimbra, Portugal, implemented together with local civil protection agents. Emergency management practitioners identified a high potential in the pictures taken in-situ by volunteers for improving situational awareness and supporting decision-making. They also pointed out to challenges associated to processing VGI and filtering high-value information in real-time." ;

The comparison shows how sense of place is dynamic and changing over time and explores Kilburn High Road through the categories of location, locale and sense of place derived from the qualitative analysis of VGI content and annotations. The contribution shows how VGI can contribute to discovering the unique relationship between people and place which takes the form given by Doreen Massey to Kilburn High Road and then moves on to the many forms given by people experiencing Kilburn High Road through a photo, a Tweet or a simple narrative. Finally, the paper suggests that the analysis of VGI content can contribute to detect the relevant features of street life, from infrastructure to citizens’ perceptions, which should be taken into account for a more human-centered approach in planning or service management." ;

The drainage networks extracted from ASTER and SRTM are generated considering several values of flow accumulation as the critical level to identify the water courses and the feature “waterway” was extracted from OSM. To assess the completeness and positional accuracy of these water courses the drainage network of the 1/25000 topographic map of the Portuguese Army Geographical Institute was used as reference.

Researchers have been very active exploring a vast amount of initiatives and trying to develop methodologies and possible real applications for this new source of geographic information. Land Use/Cover production is one of the areas where this type of geographic information might be very useful. In this paper we evaluate if geo-referenced and publicly available photos from the Flickr initiative can be used as a source of geographic information to help Land Use/Cover classification. Using the Corine Land Cover nomenclature, we compare the classification obtained for selected photo locations, against the classification obtained from high resolution satellite imagery for the same locations. We conclude that this source cannot be used alone for the purpose of Land Use/Cover classification but we also believe that it might contain helpful information if combined with other sources." ;

The phenomena is known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). During the last decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services such as environmental monitoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management etc. However, these volunteer contributed data also come with varying quality . Reasons for this are: data is produced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having dierent level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this paper, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI, and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the paper presents a classication of VGI with current methods utilized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI." ;

However, applications involving user-generated geospatial content show dramatically diversified patterns in terms of incentive, type and level of participation, purpose of the activity, data/metadata provided and data quality. This study contributes to this heterogeneous context by investigating public participation in GIS within the field of mobile-based applications. Results not only show examples of how to technically build GIS applications enabling user collection and interaction with geospatial data, but they also draw conclusions about the methods and needs of public participation. We describe three projects with different scales and purposes in the context of urban monitoring and planning, and tourism valorisation. In each case, an open source architecture is used, allowing users to exploit their mobile devices to collect georeferenced information. This data is then made publicly available on specific Web viewers. Analysis of user involvement in these projects provides insights related to participation patterns which suggests some generalized conclusions." ;

    dc:description "  OpenStreetMap   (OSM) is an extraordinarily large and diverse spatial database of the world. Road networks are amongst the most frequently occurring spatial content within the OSM database. These road network representations are usable in many applications. However the quality of these representations can vary between locations. Comparing OSM road networks with authoritative road datasets for a given area or region is an important task in assessing OSM's fitness for use for applications like routing and navigation. Such comparisons can be technically challenging and no software implementation exists which facilitates them easily and automatically. In this article we develop and propose a flexible methodology for comparing the geometry of OSM road network data with other road datasets. Quantitative measures for the completeness and spatial accuracy of OSM are computed, including the compatibility of OSM road data with other map databases. Our methodology provides users with significant flexibility in how they can adjust the parameterization to suit their needs. This software implementation is exclusively built on open source software and a significant degree of automation is provided for these comparisons. This software can subsequently be extended and adapted for comparison between OSM and other external road datasets. Github repository: " ;

This research investigates the opportunity to build up a PPGIS prototype with completely Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) architecture, in which data directly come from field surveys carried out by users. A sample application related to urban monitoring is addressed, which concentrates on user field-collected data concerning reports of road pavement damages. Open Data Kit suite allows users to collect geotagged multimedia information using mobile devices with onboard location sensors (e.g. a Global Positioning System receiver). On field-captured data are sent to a server and stored into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS spatial extension. GeoServer then disseminates data on the Web. On the client-side, different solutions allow data visualization on both desktop computers and mobile devices. The designed architecture provided support for FOSS usage in the process of gathering, uploading, and Web publishing information collected in situ. The implementation of the developed PPGIS could thus substantially increase public active participation in data creation and sharing, besides enlarging DE knowledge up to the local level." ;

While primarily the mapping party was organised as a conference social event, there was also the serious goal of collecting and adding geographic data to the OSM database of Como city. Our paper describes the organisation, planning and structure of the mapping party. Results show that considerable amounts of data was collected and uploaded to OSM. Overall there was very good interest in the mapping party with 40 participants. While the majority of participants were delegates at the conference and consequently could be considered highly skilled   GIS   practitioners only a very small number had actually contributed data to OSM in the past. We discuss the key lessons learned and overall positive and negative aspects of this mapping party." ;

    dc:description "Online collaborative mapping projects, such as   OpenStreetMap   (  OSM  ), have been developed not only to provide public and free information about many types of geospatial features, including communication and transportation networks such as roads, trails and railways, but also to give its users the chance to contribute with their local knowledge about the places. There must be, however, a special concern for the quality assurance with in these community driven maps. The aim of this paper is to assess the positional differences between the road network available in   OSM   for some regions of the Coimbra Municipality, Portugal, and the data provided by the Coimbra City Hall, considered as reference. The assessment is made by computing the distance between the features’ lines, extracted from   OSM   and the reference data, using two approaches. One regards the application of a workflow, which uses tools already available in   GIS   software. The other approach applies directly the   FOSS4G  -based procedure developed by Brovelli et al.

    dc:description "This chapter describes AtrapaelTigre.com, a citizen science project focusing on the Asian tiger mosquito in Spain. Commonly known for its aggressive biting during the day, the tiger mosquito represents a global environmental problem. It is an invasive species and a vector for dengue, chikungunya and other diseases, making it a serious public health risk. It is also an everyday nuisance and a threat to tourism and related industries. The management of invasive species, and particularly disease vectors, requires integrated programs that combine public communication and education with research, surveillance and control. AtrapaelTigre.com aims at achieving this by engaging citizen scientists to raise awareness and collect data on tiger mosquito adults and their breeding sites with a smartphone app (Tigatrapp) and a multi-proxy data validation system that combines expert, crowd, and app-user input. Lessons learned during the first year of implementation in Spain, in 2014, have guided our current strategies with respect to both tiger mosquitoes and the formal integration of citizen science into the research, surveillance and control of invasive species and disease vectors generally. We address the challenges of implementing such frameworks and discuss their fitness for use in public health systems. The goal of AtrapaelTigre.com is not only to enhance participation and raise awareness, but also to promote novel research and a more informed and cost-effective management of the tiger mosquito across Spain." ;

    dc:description "Mosquito Alert (www.mosquitoalert.com/en) is an expertvalidated citizen science platform for tracking and controlling diseasecarrying mosquitoes. Citizens download a free app and use their phones to send reports of presumed sightings of two world-wide disease vector mosquito species (the Asian Tiger and the Yellow Fever mosquito). These reports are then supervised by a team of entomologists and, once validated, added to a database. As the platform prepares to scale to much larger geographical areas and user bases, the expert validation by entomologists becomes the main bottleneck. In this paper we describe the use of machine learning on the citizen reports to automatically validate a fraction of them, therefore allowing the entomologists either to deal with larger report streams or to concentrate on those that are more strategic, such as reports from new areas (so that early warning protocols are activated) or from areas with high epidemiological risks (so that control actions to reduce mosquito populations are activated). The current prototype flags a third of the reports as “almost certainly positive” with high confidence. It is currently being integrated into the main workflow of the Mosquito Alert platform." ;

    dc:description "Abstract  The recent emergence in Europe of invasive mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease associated with both invasive and native mosquito species has prompted intensified mosquito vector research in most European countries. Central to the efforts are mosquito monitoring and surveillance activities in order to assess the current species occurrence, distribution and, when possible, abundance, in order to permit the early detection of invasive species and the spread of competent vectors. As active mosquito collection, e.g. by trapping adults, dipping preimaginal developmental stages or ovitrapping, is usually cost-, time- and labour-intensive and can cover only small parts of a country, passive data collection approaches are gradually being integrated into monitoring programmes. Thus, scientists in several EU member states have recently initiated programmes for mosquito data collection and analysis that make use of sources other than targeted mosquito collection. While some of them extract mosquito distribution data from zoological databases established in other contexts, community-based approaches built upon the recognition, reporting, collection and submission of mosquito specimens by citizens are becoming more and more popular and increasingly support scientific research. Based on such reports and submissions, new populations, extended or new distribution areas and temporal activity patterns of invasive and native mosquito species were found. In all cases, extensive media work and communication with the participating individuals or groups was fundamental for success. The presented projects demonstrate that passive approaches are powerful tools to survey the mosquito fauna in order to supplement active mosquito surveillance strategies and render them more focused. Their ability to continuously produce biological data permits the early recognition of changes in the mosquito fauna that may have an impact on biting nuisance and the risk of pathogen transmission associated with mosquitoes. International coordination to explore synergies and increase efficiency of passive surveillance programmes across borders needs to be established." ;

In East Africa, the extensive use of mobile telephony adds to the imagined promises of ICT. We reflect on the assumptions made by the proponents of such tools, using our own action research project as an example. We took great care to consider context in the development of software for enhancing empowerment and accountability in rural water supply in Tanzania. However, we found that the rural water supply context in Tanzania is much more complex than the contexts for which successful mApps have been developed previously. Institutional analysis and public administration theory help to understand why. Rural water supply shows institutional hybridity, with water being at the same time a private, public and common-pool good. In addition, in accountability relations, many informal mechanisms prevail where explicit reporting is not relevant. Finally, our proposal sat uneasily with other ongoing iGovernment initiatives. We conclude that we need to consider eGovernance tools as political Apps that can be expected to trigger political responses." ;

    dc:description "The chapter studies the spatial behavior of contributors to OpenStreetMap and links it to gamification mechanisms which provide a solution to issues that arise with patterns of participation. More specifically, three issues are identified: (1) high productive contributors show little commitment to return and update geographic features they created, (2) the gap between the accumu-lated percentage of created features and the accumulated percentage of up-dated features is widening, (3) there is a significant contrast between areas of high and low mapping activity. Spatial allocation games are described as a subclass of location-based games suitable for addressing the participation is-sues. Based on an analysis of the geogames Geographing, Foursquare, Ingress, and Neocartographer six common design patterns for the allocation and deal-location of places are identified. It is shown how the participation issues map onto the game design patterns. Results from an agent-based spatial simulation provide insights into the interaction of the spatial design pattern." ;

Two methods for improving the quality of crowdsourced data are compared: the widely used approach of mutual confirmation of data sources which is known to work well for objective data (e.g. mapping bus stops) and the retest mechanism, a technique adapted from the cognitive sciences for validating subjective data with high inter-individual variation (e.g. judgements about the safety of a place). We formulate design criteria for a game based on retesting and present the VGI game Alien GeoSpy as a proof of concept which applies both principles as in-game elements." ;

This is especially true in the scenario studied in this article: the integration of geo-tagged reports about events or incidents. Missing and conflicting values appear frequently, due to the non-professional and subjective character of such data. We discuss data quality issues in this emerging subarea of VGI and present a computational approach for handling incomplete and inconsistent data based on constraint satisfaction techniques. The method is evaluated on a dataset of reports about vegetation periods of plants. It turns out that even simple pieces of the otherwise very complex contextual information can be used to increase the quality of VGI." ;

    dc:description "There exist many popular crowdsourcing and social services (Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI)) to share information and documents such as Flickr, Foursquare, Twitter , Facebook, etc. They all use metadata, folksonomy and more importantly a geographic axis with GPS coordinates and/or geographic tags. Using this available folksonomy in VGI services we propose a logical approach to highlight and possibly discover the characteristics of geographic places. The approach is based on the notion of spatial coverage and a model of tags categorization and on their semantic identification, using semantic services such as GeoNames, OpenStreetMap or WordNet. We illustrate our model with Flickr to retrieve the characteristics (function, usage?) of places even if those places have a small number of related photos. Those found characteristics allow tag disambiguation and can be use to complete the semantic gap on places and POIs such as the function of buildings, which can exist in geographic services." ;

    dc:description "Today, a tremendous source of spatio-temporal data is user generated, so-called volunteered geographic information (VGI). Among the many VGI sources, microblogged services, such as Twitter, are extensively used to disseminate information on a near real-time basis. Interest in analysis of microblogged data has been motivated to date by many applications ranging from trend detection, early disaster warning, to urban management and marketing. One important analysis perspective in understanding microblogged data is based on the notion of drift, considering a gradual change of real world phenomena observed across space, time, content, or a combination thereof.  The scientific contribution provided by this paper is the presentation of a systematic framework that utilises on the one hand a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to detect hotspot clusters of Tweeter activities, which are episodically sequential in nature. These clusters help to derive spatial trajectories. On the other hand we introduce the concept of drift that characterises these trajectories by looking into changes of sentiment and topics to derive meaningful information. We apply our approach to a Twitter dataset comprising 26,000 tweets. We demonstrate how phenomena of interest can be detected by our approach. As an example, we use our approach to detect the locations of Lady Gaga's concert tour in 2013. A set of visualisations allows to analyse the identified trajectories in space, enhanced by optional overlays for sentiment or other parameters of interest." ;

    dc:description "With the increased availability of user generated data, assessing quality and credibility of such data becomes important. In this paper, we propose to assess the location correctness of visually generated VGI as a quality reference measure. The location correctness is determined by checking the visibility of the point of interest from the position of the visually generated VGI (observer point); as an example we utilise Flickr photographs. Therefore, we first collect all Flickr photographs that confirm to a certain point of interest through their textual labelling. Then, we conduct a reverse viewshed analysis for the point of interest to determine if it lies within the area of visibility from the observer points. If the point of interest lies outside the visibility from a given observer point, the respective geotagged image is considered to be incorrectly geotagged. This way, we analyse sample datasets of photographs and make observations regarding the dependency of certain user/photo metadata and (in)correct geotags and labels. In future the dependency relationship between the location correctness and user/photo metadata can be used to automatically infer user credibility. E.g., attributes such as profile completeness together with the location correctness can serve as a weighted score to assess credibility." ;

    dc:description "Within Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), Citizen Science stands out as a class of activities that require special attention and analysis. Citizen science is likely to be the longest running of VGI activities, with some projects showing continuous effort over a century. In addition, many projects are characterised by a genuine element of volunteering and contribution of information for the benefit of human knowledge and science. They are also tasks where data quality and uncertainty come to the fore when evaluating the validity of the results. This chapter provides an overview of citizen science in the context of VGI – hence the focus on geographic citizen science. This chapter highlights the historical context of citizen science and its more recent incarnation. It also covers some of the cultural and conceptual challenges that citizen science faces and the resulting limitation on the level of engagement. By drawing parallels with the Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) literature, the chapter offers a framework of participation in citizen science and concludes with the suggestion that a more participatory mode of citizen science is possible." ;

    dc:description "Abstract As transport systems are pushed to the limits in many cities, governments have tried to resolve problems of traffic and congestion by increasing capacity. Miller (2013) contends the need to identify new capabilities (instead of capacity) of the transport infrastructure in order to increase efficiency without extending the physical infrastructure. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) identified integrated traveller information as a facilitator for better transport decisions. Today, with fur-ther developments in the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and a greater disposition by the public to provide volunteered geographic information (VGI), the potential of information is not only integrated across modes but also us-er-generated, real-time and available on smartphones anywhere. This geographic information plays today an important role in sectors such as politics, businesses and entertainment, and presumably this would extend to transport in reveal-ing people’s preferences for mobility and therefore be useful for decision-making. The widespread availability of net-works and smartphones offer new opportunities supported by apps and crowdsourcing through social media such as the successful traffic and navigation app Waze, car sharing programmes such as Zipcar, and ride sharing systems such as Uber. This study aims to develop insights into the potential of governments to use voluntary (crowdsourced) geo-graphic information effectively to achieve sustainable mobility. A review of the literature and existing technology informs this article. Further research into this area is identified and presented at the end of the paper." ;

    dc:description "Detecting real-world events by following posts in microblogs has been the motivation of numerous recent studies. In this work, we focus on the spatio-temporal characteristics of events detected in microblogs, and propose a method to estimate their locations using the Dempster–Shafer theory. We utilize three basic location-related features of the posts, namely the latitude-longitude metadata provided by the GPS sensor of the user’s device, the textual content of the post, and the location attribute in the user profile, as three in- dependent sources of evidence. Considering this evidence in a complementary way, we apply combination rules in the Dempster–Shafer theory to fuse them into a single model, and estimate the whereabouts of a detected event. Locations are treated at two levels of granularity, namely, city and town. Using the Dempster–Shafer theory to solve this problem allows uncertainty and missing data to be tolerated, and estimations to be made for sets of locations in terms of upper and lower probabilities. We demonstrate our solution using public tweets on Twitter posted in Turkey. The experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of events including earthquakes, sports, weather, and street protests indicate higher success rates than the existing state of the art methods." ;

    dc:description "Prominence of social media such as Twitter and Facebook led to a huge collection of data over which event detection provides useful results. An important dimension of event detection is location estimation for detected events. Social media provides a variety of clues for location, such as geographical annotation from smart devices, location field in the user profile and the content of the message. Among these clues, message content needs more effort for processing, yet it is generally more informative. In this paper, we focus on extraction of location names, i.e., toponym recognition, from social media messages. We propose a a hybrid system, which uses both rule based and machine learning based techniques to extract toponyms from tweets. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is used as the machine learning tool and features such as Part-of-Speech tags and conjunction window are defined in order to construct a CRF model for toponym recognition. In the rule based part, regular expressions are used in order to define some of the toponym recognition patterns as well as to provide a simple level of normalization in order to handle the informality in the text. Experimental results show that the proposed method has higher toponym recognition ratio in comparison to the previous studies." ;
